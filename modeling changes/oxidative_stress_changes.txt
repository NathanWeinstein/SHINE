NOX2, O2 & ( p47phox | PKC ) & ( !NRF2 | !propionylLcarnitine )

NOX5, O2 & Ca2 & PIP2
Suggesed new update rules where even under very hypoxic conditions, 
the basal concentration of oxygen is sufficient to activate the NOX enzymes:
NOX2, ( p47phox | PKC ) & ( !NRF2 | !propionylLcarnitine )
NOX4, HIF1
NOX5, Ca2 & PIP2
O2 represents normoxia in our model. Hypoxia actually causes oxidative stress

see page 19 “under hypoxia, the mitochondrial complex III suffers a conformational
change that would facilitate the interaction between O2 and ubisemiquinone, resulting 
in an increase of O2•− formation (Guzy et al., 2005). Others also consider complex II 
as relevant for ROS formation during hypoxia exposure (Paddenberg et al., 2003). 
It was proposed that this complex switches its catalytic activity from succinate 
dehydrogenase to fumarate reductase at diminished oxygen levels. 
This would not only cause succinate to accumulate but additionally will cause ROS 
generation because fumarate reductase has been demonstrated to be a powerful O2•− 
generator”)
Also, HIF1 directly activates NOX4
