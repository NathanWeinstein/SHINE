Understanding our Boolean model

Unless otheways stated: 
0 represents a molecule that is not active enough to elicit certain effects
1 represents a concentration or activity level that is high enough to cause 
the above effects.

Interpreting a BoolNet update rule
The form of an update rule is:
target, factors
Where target is the molecule or node that is affected by the factors.
factors is a Boolean function that determinates if the target will be active or 
inactive after an update.

The boolean opperators are ! (Not), & (And), and | (Or)
! Is usually used to represent an inibitory regulation
Example:
target, !inhibitor
If the inhibitor is not active, the target will be active.

& usually groups several interdependent conditions 
Example:   
The complex formed by B and LEF1 activates the transcription of claudin_1
claudin_1, B & LEF1

| represents independent conditions to regulate the activity of a target
Example:
Gene1 has two enhancers, enhancer 1 can be activated by TF1, and enhancer 2 can be activated by TF2.
Gene1, TF1 | TF2

The conditions that should result in endothelial quiescence are the following:
ANG1 = 1, # Pericites cover mature continuos capillaries and secrete ANG1.
heparan_sulfate = 1, # The healthy glycocalyx contains enough HS.
O2 = 1, # Normoxic conditions.
WNT7a = 1, # Canonical WNT signaling appears to be important for EC quiescence.
ShearStress = 1, # In our model this represents the normal shear stress caused by 
EPI = 0,
NE = 0, Catecholamines should result in non-quiescent behavior
constant laminar blood flow in the capillaries.
Under these conditions, we expect high endothelial barrier function, 
low oxidative stress, no glycocalyx function and no endothelial dysfunction.

For endothelial barrier function:
This is the update rule for endothelial barrier function:
barrier_function, ZO1 & CDH5 & (Claudin1_3 | Claudin5) & Occludin
What this means is that according to our model both adherence and tight junctions
must be stable. Adherence junctions require VE-cadherin (CDH5) and ZO1, 
tight junctions require ZO1, occludin, and a claudin.

a)
Old: CDH5, !SRC & !ACTB & Ca2 & (CREB1 | RRAS | FZD7 | FAK | ADD | AF6 | KRIT1 | RAC1)
New: CDH5, !SRC & !ACTB & (CREB1 | RRAS | FZD7 | FAK | ADD | AF6 | KRIT1 | RAC1) 
# Wat this implies is that basal Ca2+ is enough for VE-cadherin function
b)
Old: Occludin, ZO1 & !ADD
New: Occludin, ZO1 | !ADD 
# ADD is activated by RAC1 which preserves barrier function. 
# Therefore, ADD should not be a dominant inhibitor.
c)
Old: SRC, !mDia & ( ARRB1 | TSAd | JAK )
New: SRC, !mDia & ARRB1 & (TSAd | JAK ) 
# SRC needs to be activated by different pathways to reach the threshold
# to inhibit VE-cadherin

For oxydative stress and glycocalyx shedding which are closely related,
the update rules are:
oxidative_stress, Superoxide | H2O2
glycocalyx_shedding, !Syndecan1

Required changes:

d)
Old: MMP24_25, lysophospholypids
New: MMP24_25, lysophospholypids & ( Superoxide | H2O2 ) 
# ROS oxidate lysophospholypids increasing the affinity of 
# MMP24_25 for these substrates

e)
Old: NFkB, PECAM1 | NOX4
New: NFkB, PECAM1 & NOX4 
# To avoid ectopic HIF1A activation because 
# normal shear stress activates PECAM1

f)
Old: Ca2, !SERCA & (IP3R | PIEZO1 | TRPV4 | Cav)
New: Ca2, !SERCA & IP3R & PIEZO1 & TRPV4 & Cav 
# This prevents ectopic activation. Additionally during the transition 
# to quiescence we where observing an atypical activation of MLC caused
# by Ca2+ increases

g)
Old:O2, O2 | SOD
New: O2, O2 
# SOD is not enough to suply sufficient oxygen

Endothelial dysfunction
Functional endothelial cells produce both nitric oxide and prostacyclin.
endothelyal_dysfunction, !NO | !PGI2

Changes:

g)
Old: COX1, AA & !NO
New: COX1, AA | !NO 
# For COX1, the NO threshold is high, the & resulted 
# in either PGI2 or NO production. 
# This is a feedback mechanism that regulates both NO and PGI2. 
# Another option would be to add another level to NO, like NO_high
# that would inhibit COX1

We did not have cAMP production.

Changes:

h) 
Old: AC, (PKC | Gs | Gq | CAM) & !Gi
New: AC, PKC | CAM | Gs | ( Gq & !Gi )  
# This was too strict, not enough cAMP


Constant blood flow-associated shear stess (ShearStress = 1)
maintains quiescence through several mechanisms, the following 
changes are needed to include those mechanisms in the model.

i)
Old: PI3K, Gi | ( TIE2 & Lactate) | VEGFR12 | AXL | JAK
New: PI3K, Gi | ( TIE2 & Lactate) | VEGFR12 | AXL | JAK | PECAM1
# PECAM1 activates PI3K, resulting in eNOS and AKT1 simulation

j) Found a mistake:
Old: TLE1, Bcatenin
New: TLE1, !Bcatenin
# B catenin displaces TLE1, preventing it from inhibiting LEF1

k) Ang1 promotes the activation of mDia through RhoA, inhibiting SRC-mediated 
VE-cadherin phospphorylation. In our model RHOA activity is associated with 
incrreassed permeability, perhaps a diirect interaction from TIE2 to mDia skiping
 RhoA would be less problematic here. Another option would be: 
 TIE2 --| RHOA --| mDia
